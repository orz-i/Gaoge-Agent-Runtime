# Agent Runtime Core

`github.com/orz-i/Gaoge-Agent-Runtime/go/agent-runtime` is the host-neutral Agent Runtime
Core. The module is split into explicit capability packages such as `kernel`,
`agent`, `tools`, `interaction`, `planexecute`, `workflow`, `team`, and
`compose`. Hosts construct only the capabilities they need; there is no
compatibility `Engine` facade or automatic Runtime-kind selector.

For an in-process durable-contract implementation, use `memory`:

```go
store := memory.NewStore()
runtime, err := kernel.New(kernel.Dependencies{Store: store})
```

Production hosts normally pair Core with the PostgreSQL Store and either the
Redis or memory generation stream adapter.

## Runtime kinds

Agent Runtime exposes explicit Run kinds over the same durable Kernel primitives:

- Agent Run is the direct model/Tool loop and is provided by `agent.Runner`.
- Plan-and-Execute owns model-generated plans and executes steps through an injected Agent Runner.
- Agent Team is coordinator-led, open-ended multi-agent collaboration.
- Dynamic Workflow is a versioned, deterministic DSL with structured data,
  bounded concurrency, hard budgets, durable waits, cache policy, and
  compensation.

These kinds do not masquerade as one another through modes or compatibility
facades. Callers select the Runtime kind before Run creation.

Kernel terminal output remains feature-neutral through `kernel.Result`; each
Feature owns the schema placed in that result. Provider-specific protocols and
host business objects stay outside Kernel.
