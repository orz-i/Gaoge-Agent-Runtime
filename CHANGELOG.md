# Changelog

All notable changes are documented here. This project follows Semantic
Versioning once it reaches `v1.0.0`; prereleases use SemVer prerelease labels.

## [0.1.0-beta.2] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- Explicit `protocol.a2a` microkernel plugin and finite `a2a:<public-id>`
  handoff routing without adding protocol dependencies to the kernel.
- A2A 1.0 HTTP+JSON client and server surfaces for Agent Card discovery,
  messages, streaming, artifacts, task get/list/cancel, and task subscription.
- Durable shadow runs with frozen discovery revisions, resumable
  input/auth-required waits, cancellation, and recovery after restart.
- Host-neutral authentication, tenant-scoped optimistic task persistence,
  Agent Card cache validators, and a pinned official A2A TCK runner.

### Changed

- A2A moves from experimental to Beta-supported for the documented HTTP+JSON
  surface. JSON-RPC, gRPC, push notifications, and extended cards remain out of
  scope and fail closed.
- Handoff accepts a narrow product-owned child resolver through
  `handoff.NewRouted`; the existing static `handoff.New` path is unchanged.

### Security

- Production A2A hosting now requires HTTPS, explicit authentication, durable
  owner/tenant-scoped storage, and declared Agent Card security requirements.
- Endpoint validation, same-origin redirect policy, reserved-header protection,
  bounded remote data, and generic persisted transport errors are enforced at
  the edge.

### Verification

- Official A2A TCK commit `5996b79f9cefa6fc390980e383e358a66fb9e49e`
  reports 100% compatibility for the selected HTTP+JSON surface (85 passed,
  180 intentional scope skips, zero failures).

## [0.1.0-beta.1] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- Durable Kernel run state machine with optimistic concurrency.
- Agent, tool, approval, continuation, workflow, team, and evaluation features.
- Harness turn orchestration with Context V2 checkpoints, compaction, durable
  artifacts, interactions, delegation, and recovery.
- PostgreSQL, Redis, HTTP v1, MCP, A2A, and TypeScript client adapters.
- Real PostgreSQL and Redis integration gates plus clean-consumer release tests.

### Beta notes

- A2A integration is experimental.
- Persisted schemas are forward-migrated; downgrade migrations are not
  provided during Beta.
- Source compatibility may change between Beta releases and will be recorded
  in this changelog.
